# About the app

This is a xylophone app. When you run it you'll see 7 colorful buttons that you can click which produces a sound.

## Getting Started

I used the web setup to make the flutter app. Please follow the [official docs to install flutter web](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/web).

When you have flutter installed use `flutter pub get` to install the necessary dependencies and `flutter run` to start the application.

The interesting code bit for the app lives in `/lib/main.dart`.
